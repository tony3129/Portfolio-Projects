                Hello, my name is Tony. I once had a career in construction, I worked for a few construction management,
                and consultancy firms as a Construction Estimator or Cost Consultant. I would basically 
                develop estimates for how much Condos specifically would cost developers to build through 
                the company I worked for. Honestly, it was a great career - good job stability, and it paid well. However, 
                for the 4 years I spent in construction, I never really liked doing it. I thought as 
                I got better at my job I would begin to like it, but that never happened. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I originally didn't believe I had the brain to do software development, but
                I've always been interested in Technology as a whole, even as I was working in
                construction I would keep up to date with the latest software development and
                hardware news. After excelling in a career that I didn't enjoy I believed I could
                also excel in development, so I took the dive, and enrolled in the Computer Programming
                diploma program at Seneca Polytechnic. I've completed the program with a 4.0 GPA
                average, and believe that for someone of my level of experience I have a 
                deeper understanding of development than my peers.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am currently looking for any development role, I want to get my foot in the door
                and learn as much as I can. I believe I am a hard worker - I will put in the time to learn what
                I need and more. I work well in a team, I take responsibility for my tasks, and I do all I can to
                help my co-workers. Due to the above qualities, every company I've worked at has told me that I can
                always return to my previous positions if I chose to. If given the chance, I believe I would be a 
                contributing member of any team. 
                <br>
                <br>
